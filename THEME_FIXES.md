# Theme Switching and Header Menu Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Theme Toggle Not Working**: The ThemeToggle component was using a plain HTML button with custom CSS classes that weren't properly integrated with Ant Design's component system.

2. **Layout Issue Preventing Clicks**: There was a potential alignment issue in the header causing components to overlap or misalign, preventing clicks on the MessageHistory component.

## Changes Made

### 1. ThemeToggle Component (`src/components/common/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used plain HTML `<button>` with custom SVG icons and CSS class `theme-toggle`
- **After**: Converted to Ant Design `Button` component with `SunOutlined` and `MoonOutlined` icons
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent styling with other Ant Design components
  - Better integration with Ant Design's theme system
  - Proper click handling and accessibility

### 2. MainLayout Component (`src/components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`)
- **Change**: Added `align="center"` prop to the header's Space component
- **Line**: 348
- **Purpose**: Ensures all header components are vertically centered, preventing layout shifts

### 3. LanguageSelector Component (`src/components/common/LanguageSelector.tsx`)
- **Change**: Removed `size="large"` prop from the Select component
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent sizing with other header components

### 4. CSS Cleanup (`src/styles/themes.css`)
- **Change**: Removed the entire `.theme-toggle` CSS block (lines 96-120)
- **Purpose**: Prevents CSS conflicts with the new Ant Design Button implementation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Theme Switching**:
   - Click the theme toggle button (sun/moon icon)
   - Verify the theme switches between light and dark modes
   - Check that all components update their colors appropriately

2. **Header Layout**:
   - Verify all header components are properly aligned
   - Click on each component (Language Selector, Theme Toggle, Message History)
   - Ensure no components overlap or block clicks on others

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Check both light and dark themes in each browser

## Additional Considerations

The theme system is properly configured in:
- `App.tsx`: ConfigProvider with dynamic theme algorithm
- `ThemeContext.tsx`: Theme state management and DOM updates
- `themes.css`: CSS variables for both light and dark themes

The fixes ensure better integration with Ant Design's component system while maintaining the custom theme functionality.
