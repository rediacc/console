# Packages allowed to be outdated
#
# Format: package-name@<max-version # reason
# The package will be allowed to stay outdated as long as latest < max-version
# Once latest >= max-version, the check will fail (forcing review)
#
# Semver constraint examples:
#   @pkg@<3.0.0  - Allow any 2.x, fail when 3.0.0+ is available
#   @pkg@<2.9.0  - Allow up to 2.8.x, fail when 2.9.0+ is available
#
# To add a package to this list:
# 1. Identify the package that cannot be upgraded
# 2. Document the reason (compatibility issue, breaking change, etc.)
# 3. Set max-version to the version that would require review
# 4. Create an issue to track the upgrade
#
# Example:
# some-package@<3.0.0 # Reason for deferral

@ant-design/pro-components@<3.0.0 # React 19 not yet supported (PR #9357)

# Major version upgrades - require compatibility review
@ant-design/icons@<7.0.0 # v6.x requires antd 6.x migration
antd@<7.0.0 # v6.x is a major rewrite, requires migration guide
astro-seo@<2.0.0 # v1.x has breaking API changes
date-fns@<5.0.0 # v4.x has breaking API changes
electron@<41.0.0 # v40.x requires Electron upgrade review
globals@<18.0.0 # v17.x has breaking changes for ESLint config
