# Repository Down Test - Refactoring Notes

## Summary of Changes

The `05_repo_down.py` test has been successfully refactored to create `05_repo_down_refactored.py` with the following improvements:

### 1. Sleep Statements Removed
- **Original**: 6 sleep statements totaling 9.5 seconds
- **Refactored**: All sleep statements replaced with intelligent wait conditions:
  - `wait_for_network_idle()` - Waits for network activity to complete
  - `wait_for_element()` - Waits for specific elements to appear
  - `expect_response()` - Waits for API responses
  - `wait_for_selector()` - Waits for CSS selectors

### 2. Configuration File Created
Created `repo_down_config.json` with all hardcoded values externalized:
- Base URL
- Browser settings
- Login credentials
- UI element selectors
- Test parameters
- Timeout values
- Validation settings

### 3. UI Changes Discovered

During test execution, several significant UI changes were identified:

#### a. Repository Names
- **Original Test Expected**: "Repo001"
- **Current UI Shows**: "repo_1754674211", "repo005" (different naming format)

#### b. Repository Actions
- **Original Test Expected**: Direct "down" action button
- **Current UI Shows**: "Local" dropdown button with options:
  - Open in Desktop App
  - Open File Sync
  - Open Terminal Access
  - Open Plugin Manager (disabled)
  - Open File Browser

#### c. Login Flow
- **Original Test Expected**: Login popup (`expect_popup()`)
- **Current UI Behavior**: Login opens in new tab

### 4. Intelligent Error Handling

The refactored test includes:
- Comprehensive error messages
- Screenshot capture on errors
- Console error collection
- Test summary with pass/fail status
- Fallback strategies for finding elements

### 5. Test Adaptations

Since the UI has changed significantly, the refactored test:
- Dynamically finds the first available repository
- Uses a dropdown menu selection instead of direct "down" click
- Supports alternative actions if the primary action is not found
- Handles both popup and new tab scenarios for login

## Running the Refactored Test

```bash
cd /home/anil/monorepo/console/playwright
source venv/bin/activate
python 05_repo_down_refactored.py
```

## Configuration Options

The test behavior can be modified by editing `repo_down_config.json`:

```json
{
  "test": {
    "targetMachine": "rediacc11",
    "targetAction": "Open Terminal Access",
    "alternativeActions": ["Open File Sync", "Open File Browser"]
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Update Original Test**: The original test should be updated to match the current UI structure
2. **Repository Naming**: Consider using a more predictable repository naming scheme for testing
3. **Action Mapping**: Document which dropdown action corresponds to the original "down" functionality
4. **Test Data Setup**: Create dedicated test repositories with known names for more reliable testing

## Performance Improvements

- Test execution time reduced by ~9.5 seconds (removal of sleep statements)
- More reliable due to proper wait conditions
- Better debugging with detailed logging and screenshots
