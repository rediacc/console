# Quick Start

Welcome to Rediacc. This section walks you through everything you need to deploy encrypted, isolated infrastructure on your own servers.

## Getting Started

Follow these pages in order:

1. **[Requirements](/en/docs/requirements)** — Supported operating systems and prerequisites for your workstation and remote servers.

2. **[Installation](/en/docs/installation)** — Install the `rdc` CLI on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

3. **[Step-by-Step Guide](/en/docs/guide)** — Create a context, add machines, create encrypted repositories, and deploy services.

4. **[Post-Installation](/en/docs/post-installation)** — Configure autostart, understand the context config, and troubleshoot common issues.

5. **[Tools](/en/docs/tools)** — File sync, SSH terminal, VS Code integration, CLI updates, and diagnostics.

## What is Rediacc?

Rediacc deploys containerized services on remote servers you control. Everything is encrypted at rest using LUKS, every repository gets its own isolated Docker daemon, and all orchestration happens over SSH from your workstation.

No cloud accounts. No SaaS dependencies. Your data stays on your servers.

## Next Steps

- **[CLI Reference](/en/docs/cli-application)** — Complete command reference for the `rdc` CLI.
- **[Web Application](/en/docs/web-application)** — Manage infrastructure through the web console.
