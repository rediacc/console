For @packages/www/ project: Refactor the website codebase to reduce total line count while preserving identical functionality, UI/UX, accessibility, performance, and test outcomes; prioritize consolidation while keeping changes safe, readable, and consistent with existing conventions. Work in small, reviewable commits and clearly explains each refactor, including measurable evidence (files touched, net LOC reduction). After every meaningful change, run existing checks (build/lint) and visually verify key pages and flows using https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser by capturing screenshots of before/after states; if any visual or behavioral discrepancy appears, revert or adjust and re-verify. Always search for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce code further—never state that you are “done” or that there is nothing left to improve; instead, continue iterating with the next best refactor candidate and verification cycle.
