# GitHub Actions allowed to be outdated
#
# Format: owner/repo@<max-version # reason
# The action will be allowed to stay outdated as long as latest < max-version
# Once latest >= max-version, the check will fail (forcing review)
#
# Version constraint examples:
#   actions/checkout@<v6  - Allow any v5.x, fail when v6.0.0+ is available
#   owner/action@<v3      - Allow any v2.x, fail when v3.0.0+ is available
#
# To add an action to this list:
# 1. Identify the action that cannot be upgraded
# 2. Document the reason (breaking change, compatibility issue, etc.)
# 3. Set max-version to the version that would require review
# 4. Create an issue to track the upgrade
#
# Example:
# softprops/action-gh-release@<v3 # v2 has breaking output format changes

# Major version upgrades - require compatibility review
actions/checkout@<v7 # v6.x is a major upgrade, needs review
actions/upload-artifact@<v7 # v6.x changed artifact format/API
actions/download-artifact@<v8 # v7.x changed artifact format/API
actions/upload-pages-artifact@<v5 # v4.x needs GitHub Pages workflow review
