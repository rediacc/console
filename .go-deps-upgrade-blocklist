# Go packages blocked from auto-upgrade (require manual migration)
#
# Format: module/path # reason
# These packages will NOT be upgraded automatically.
# Minor and patch updates that are not blocked will fail CI.
# Major updates are always reported but never auto-upgraded regardless of this list.
#
# Example:
# github.com/some/package # Reason for blocking

# Docker SDK - v26+ has major API and package path changes (e.g., client.NewClientWithOpts signature)
github.com/docker/docker # v26+ has breaking API changes requiring migration
