# Security audit allowlist for dev-only dependencies.
# Enforced by .ci/scripts/security/audit.sh (two-pass strategy):
#
#   Pass 1 — production deps (--omit=dev): ZERO TOLERANCE, no allowlist.
#            Any severity → hard fail.
#   Pass 2 — dev deps: this allowlist applies.
#
# Rules:
#   - NEVER add production dependency advisories here; they cannot be allowlisted.
#   - Only add dev-dependency advisories after confirming no upgrade path exists.
#   - Format: ADVISORY_ID   # short description (GHSA-xxx)
